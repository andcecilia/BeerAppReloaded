## BeerAppRealoded

**This is an iOS app I made using Swift5 and UIKit.\
I used AlamoFire and AlamoFireImages to stablish the connection with [Punk Api](https://punkapi.com/).\
The first view shows a list of beers, when tapping on the beer the user chooses there will be a second view showing the details such as image, name, tagline, alcohol content, bitterness and a short description of the chosen beer.**
